kramdown Documentation
======================

Overview
--------

kramdown is first and foremost a library for converting text written in a superset of Markdown to HTML. However, due to its modular architecture it is able to support additional input and output formats. The following input and output formats are currently supported:

* Input: [kramdown][kramdown Parser] (a superset of Markdown), [Markdown][Markdown Parser], [Github Flavored Markdown][GFM Parser], [HTML][HTML Parser]
* Output: [HTML][HTML Converter], [LaTeX][LaTeX Converter], [kramdown][kramdown Converter], [RemoveHtmlTags][RemoveHtmlTags Converter] (a special converter which removes HTML tags, normally used in conjunction with the LaTeX or kramdown converters)

The [kramdown syntax page][kramdown Syntax] describes in detail what is supported and how it differs from standard Markdown.

For all available options have a look at the [options documentation][Available Options] or have a look at a parser/converter page to see which options they support!


Usage
-----

The kramdown package provides two ways for using it:


### As a library

kramdown uses basically the same API as [RedCloth](http://redcloth.org/), [BlueCloth](http://deveiate.org/projects/BlueCloth) and [Maruku](http://maruku.rubyforge.org/):

~~~ruby
require 'kramdown'

puts Kramdown::Document.new(text).to_html
~~~

The second parameter to the new call is an options hash for (de)activating certain features. For example, to disable automatic header ID generation, you can do the following:

~~~ruby
puts Kramdown::Document.new(text, :auto_ids => false).to_html
~~~

The default parser used is kramdown, however, you can select a different one with the :input option:

~~~ruby
puts Kramdown::Document.new(text, :input => 'html').to_latex
~~~

You can also reuse the created document object to produce multiple outputs:

~~~ruby
doc = Kramdown::Document.new(text, :input => 'html')
puts doc.to_html
puts doc.to_latex
~~~

More information on how to use or extend kramdown can be found in the [API documentation]!


### As an application

Together with the library files a binary called kramdown is shipped which can be used to convert text in any supported input format to any supported output format. It either reads from the files specified as the command line arguments or from the standard input. For example:

~~~ruby
kramdown path/to/kramdown/doc/syntax.page
~~~

The input and output formats as well as all available kramdown options are supported through command line switches.


Tests
-----

kramdown uses various test suites to verify the correct working of the parsers and converters. For more information, have a look at the [tests document][Tests and Benchmark].
